        "Nowadays, hotel reviews play a vital role in helping travelers make informed decisions when choosing accommodation. As online booking platforms continue to grow, there is an increasing demand for a structured and reliable system to manage hotel reviews and user information efficiently. In response to this need, the **TravelGo Hotel Review System** has been developed to support TravelGo, a global hotel booking and review platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TravelGo Hotel Review System** is a comprehensive solution designed to manage hotel review data and user activity in an organized manner. The system allows users to explore available hotels, read existing reviews, and submit new reviews with ratings and written feedback. To encourage user participation, a points-based mechanism is implemented to track user activity, evaluate engagement, and automatically update membership categories based on accumulated points.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this documentation, the features and functionalities of the TravelGo Hotel Review System will be discussed in detail. The report explains how the system operates, the algorithms used to process reviews and user data, as well as the methods applied to update membership categories. Additionally, the limitations and constraints of the system are examined to provide a clear understanding of its scope. Ultimately, this report aims to present a functional and user-friendly program that supports TravelGo in managing hotel reviews while enhancing user engagement."

        "Develop a program that utilises file handling to manage hotel reviews and user information efficiently. The system should be able to list all reviews based on selected hotels and the reviewer’s UserID or Username. When a new review is added, the hotel’s average rating must be updated accordingly. The program must read data from existing files and allow new information to be added through user input. For each new review, the hotel’s average rating and total number of reviews must be recalculated, and the entered information should be appended to the existing files to be used as input in the next program execution.\n",

        "In addition, the system should track user activity by assigning points for each review submitted and automatically update the user’s membership category based on accumulated points.

        "\n",
        "**Pre-existing Data:**\n",
        "1. It is assumed that the source files **users.txt** and **review.txt** are pre-created and located in the same directory as the program executable.\n",
        "2. The data stored in the input files is assumed to be in the correct and predefined format. It expects specific data types in specific columns (e.g., integers for points/ratings, strings for names) to ensure the read file functions operate without errors.\n",
        "3. It is assumed that every UserID listed in **review.txt** corresponds to a valid, existing user in **users.txt**. There are no \"orphan\" reviews; the system assumes that any user who has left a review is already fully registered in the user database.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Integrity:**\n",
        "1. The program utilizes fixed-size arrays for memory management. It is assumed that the total number of users and reviews will not exceed the defined limit of 100 entries during the execution of the program.\n",
        "2. For the point calculation algorithm, it is assumed that words in a review statement are separated by single spaces. The system counts words based on space delimiters to award the \"Long Review Bonus\" (10 points per 50 words).\n",
        "3. It is assumed that the rating for every review is always an integer and falls strictly within the valid range of 1 to 5.\n",
        "4. The system calculates the total number of reviews for each user by dividing their Current Points by 100. This assumes that all historical reviews were under 50 words and therefore did not earn any \"Long Review Bonus\" points.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Focus on New Reviews:**\n",
        "1. It is assumed that no new users will be registered during the program's runtime. When submitting a review, the entered UserID must match an existing record in users.txt. The system does not support creating new user profiles; it only processes activities for pre-registered users.\n",
        "2. Unlike users, it is assumed that new hotels can be introduced to the system at any time. If a user submits a review for a hotel that does not currently exist in the database, the system accepts it as a valid new entry and begins tracking statistics for that hotel immediately.\n",
        "3. It is assumed that when a user inputs a hotel name for a new review, the capitalization exactly matches the existing records. Since the system treats case variations as distinct entities, it is assumed that users will adhere to the established capitalization format to ensure the review is correctly assigned to the intended hotel.\n",

        "In this section, we demonstrate the system’s capability to filter and display high-quality feedback. This function allows users to view only the \"Positive\" reviews (defined as ratings of 4 or 5 stars) for a selected hotel.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to the standard hotel review display, the program first generates a numbered list of available hotels for selection. However, the retrieval process includes an additional conditional check to exclude any reviews with a rating below 4. This feature is useful for identifying the best-performing aspects of a specific hotel based on the latest real-time data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Logic & Outcomes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scenario 1: Positive Reviews Exist**. If the selected hotel has reviews with a rating of 4 or 5, the system retrieves these specific entries. It resolves the reviewer's User ID to a Username and displays the review details.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scenario 2: No Positive Reviews Found**. It is possible for a hotel to exist in the system (having only low ratings, e.g., 1-3 stars). In this case, if the filter finds no matches meeting the \"Positive\" criteria, the program displays the specific notification: \"No positive reviews found for this hotel.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scenario 3: Invalid Hotel Selection**. If the user enters an index number that is not currently in the generated list (e.g., entering \"5\" when only 3 hotels are listed), the program detects the invalid input and displays the error message: \"Hotel not found! Please use the hotel listed above!\".\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step-by-Step Execution:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Program directs the user to the Main Menu.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. User selects Menu choice [4] Positive Hotel Reviews by inputting 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Program displays a numbered list of available hotels.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. User inputs the index number corresponding to their desired hotel.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Program validates the input index:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If the index is out of range: The system displays \"Hotel not found! Please use the hotel listed above!\".\n",
        "\n",
        "- If the index is valid: The program proceeds to filter the reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. For a valid hotel, the program searches for reviews with Rating $\\ge$ 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If found, positive reviews are listed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If not found, the \"No positive reviews\" message is shown.\n",

This allows the system to find relevant sentences even if the keyword is in the middle of a paragraph.\n",
